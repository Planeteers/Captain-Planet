"Captain Planet" is a robot built at Southern Illinios University Edwardsville 
to compete in the 2012 IEEE Region 5 robot competition.

We are not claiming to have created the name Captain Planet, nore the team name
Planeteers.  We are borrowing these names because the competition theme is 
Green Technologies and we thought the name would prove to be entertaining and 
fitting.
